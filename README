Zellij Prototypes.

This software uses tile packing with some symmetry awareness and some domain specific heuristics
to prepare motifs in the Zellij style.

DEPENDENCIES

go (tested under darwin and linux 6g)
gocairo (with the custom patches applied to make it work. Sadly the maintainer seems to have abandoned it)
cairo
redo (build tool)

BUILDING

If all dependencies are installed:

$ redo all

will build the entire system.

BINARIES

interactive

Starts a webhost listening on localhost:10000 to provide an interactive Zellij skeleton designer/embellisher.

enumerate

Provides an offline brute-force enumerator of possible embellishments of a given skeleton.

BUGS

Many. 

The overlay code has an odd number of handedness errors when handling 45 degree rotations that was never completely tracked
down, this is probably the root cause of:

-Period two and three octagons not always tiled correctly.
-Duplicate period one octagons appear in the enumeration despite this not being supposed to happen.

In enumerate, when enumerating at a low symmetry order, embelishments that are rotations of one another
are both found. No heuristic is implemented to avoid this extra work.

To configure the decoration colouring (which is automatic) the code currently must be edited and recompiled.

Go is a moving langauge, but has stabilized much more. This codebase is very suseptible to bitrot, worse
is that it depends on an unmaintained package.
